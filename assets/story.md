I first discovered  Apple Shortcuts in November 2022 while trying to streamline a few repetitive tasks on my iPhone.

Over time, I realized how much these simple “applets” were transforming my daily life. What started as a curiosity quickly turned into a game changer—the more I built and used them, the more they help me to _save time_, _reduce friction_, and _reclaim control over how I use my phone_.

It made too big of a difference to keep to myself—so I decided to make it public and become a Shortcuts evangelist, committed to show people what was possible and how it could make their lives easier, just like it did for me.
